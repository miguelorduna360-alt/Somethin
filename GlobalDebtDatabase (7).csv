,Global Debt Database,,
,"The Global Debt Database (GDD) is the result of a multiyear investigative process that started with the October 2016 Fiscal Monitor. The dataset comprises total gross debt of the (private and public) nonfinancial sector for an unbalanced panel of 190 advanced economies, emerging market economies and low-income countries, dating back to 1950. For more details on the methodology and definitions, please see the Mbaye, Moreno Badia and Chae (2018).

We rely on the feedback from users to address any problems they may encounter with the data. Notification of any omissions or supplementary sources is welcome and would be fully acknowledged. Suggestions can be sent to IMF-GDD@imf.org.",,
